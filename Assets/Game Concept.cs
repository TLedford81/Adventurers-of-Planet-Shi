Adventurers of Planet Shi!

You're an adventurer who was born on Planet Shi
Your mom and dad died when you were 12 because of the many monsters who have taken over the planet
In search of revenge, you find your father's old Kendo sword, and start to practice sword fighting

The game takes place when you are older (Maybe 17? 22?), now ready to fight back against the monsters who killed your parents

The gameplay is based on a mix of Binding of Isaac's Item system and We Need to go Deeper's Cave System

You will start off in the plains at your house, as your progress you will start to find more and more biomes with harder and harder creatures
Along the way you may find some Caves or Dungeons or something that contain loot that will help you on your journey
